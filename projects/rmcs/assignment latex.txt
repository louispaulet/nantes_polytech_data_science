\section{Exercise 1}

This assignment is divided into different sections and subsections. The first
sections is called Exercise 1 and this section contains two subsections Exercise
1.1 and Exercise 1.2. Exercise 1.1 contains a numbered list over the authors
favorite colours. Exercise 1.2 contains some mathematical expressions.

\subsection{Exercise 1.1}

My favorite colours are:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Blue
\item \textit{Red}
\item \textbf{Yellow}
\item \textsc{Green}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Exercise 1.2}
To be able to write mathematics in LATEX, you may have to load some packages.
Now we can try to write a quite simple one, numbered.

\begin{equation}
\int_{0}^{\infty}{\frac{\sin x}{x}}dx
\end{equation}

Note that the number near the equations allows to easily refer to it. In Eq. (1),
we are integrating a sinusoidal function on $\mathbb{R}^+$. Another possibility is to present
some aligned lines without numbers.


\begin{align*}
 a^2 + b^2 & = c^2 \\
 a_{1} + b_{1} & = \alpha c_{1} \\
 a_{2} & = c_{1} + c_{2}
\end{align*}

Equations can also be gathered.

\begin{equation}
\sum_{n=0}^{100} n^2-n = 123456
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\sqrt{x^2+y^2} = z
\end{equation}

To make the reading easier, there are a lot of different boundaries, here are some
of them

\begin{equation}
\left\{ \left[ \left( \frac{\pi^2 \Delta}{\varepsilon} \right) \right]\right\}
\end{equation}

\section{Exercise 2}

This section contains a table on some movies. The first column in Table 1 is left
aligned, the second column is right aligned end the third column is centered.
Note that we can also number the tables for reference.



\begin{table}[h!]
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|l | r | c|}
\hline
\textbf{Name of the movie} & Length & Grade\\
\hline
Die Hard & 131 min & \textcolor{green}{A} \\
The fellowship of the ring & 178 min & B \\
Titanic & 195 min & \textcolor{red}{E} \\
Rush hour & 98 min & C \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{A table on some movies}
\label{table:1}
\end{center}
\end{table}

\definecolor{ballblue}{rgb}{0.13, 0.67, 0.8}

As you can see, this is quite easy to add color to your text, as well as adding
\colorbox{ballblue}{some colored boxes} . However, be sure to use a correct combination of colors,
otherwise, \colorbox{blue}{\textcolor{ballblue}{it becomes almost unreadable}} .

\section{Exercise 3}

We are going to insert a picture in this section. You can use your own picture,
but be sure to scale it in latex so that it looks like the same way as in this
document. We can also refer to such images, as shown by Figure 1.

\begin{figure}[h!]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=8cm]{assignment_latex_picture.png}
\caption{ This is Data Science, the width of the picture is 8cm !}
  \label{fig:dataScience}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

\section{Exercise 4}  

This section contains the last task. You will find a longer calculation.

\begin{equation*} \label{eq1}
\begin{split}
\int_{x_{p}}^{\infty}{x}dF & = \int_{x_{p}}^{\infty}{xf(x)}dx \\
 & = \int_{x_{p}}^{\infty}{x\frac{ab^a}{x^{a+1}}}dx \\
 & = \lim_{R\to\infty} ab^a \int_{x_{p}}^{R}{\frac{1}{x^a}}dx
\end{split}
\end{equation*}

After this calculation, we insert a table of contents, a list of floats, and some
references. Therefore, we need to cite these interesting papers \cite{latexcompanion}, and \cite{einstein}, but
also this classic book \cite{knuthwebsite}.
